### Overview

My research deals with mathematical modeling of complex systems and statistical signal processing, for information inference and decision making. A detailed list of my ongoing and past research projects are listed below.

Currently at Washington University in St. Louis, I have been working on several research projects:

* Modeling, detecting, and tracking of freezing of gait in Parkinson disease.
* Identification of sleep-EEG based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.
* Target detection using weather radars and electromagnetic vector sensors.[[_More_]](/research/wradaremvs/)

During my stay at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, I worked on the following projects:

* Foot-mounted indoor navigation system for indoor positioning.
* Modeling and classification of vehicles using magnetometers.

At Rockwell Collins, Inc., I worked on the following project:

* Development of synoptic, and engine indication and crew alerting system, applications using model-based engineering for Embraer and Legacy jets.
