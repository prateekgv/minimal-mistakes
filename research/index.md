### Overview

My research deals with mathematical modeling of complex systems and statistical signal processing, for information inference and decision making. A detailed list of my ongoing and past research projects are listed below.

As a Graduate Research Assistant at Washington University in St. Louis, I have been working on several research projects. These include

* Modeling, detecting, and tracking of freezing of gait in Parkinson disease. [\[<span style="color:blue">_More_</span>\]](/research/freezegait/)
* Identification of sleep-EEG based biomarkers in Alzheimer disease.
* Target detection using weather radars and electromagnetic vector sensors. [\[<span style="color:blue">_More_</span>\]](/research/wradaremvs/)

As a Project Assistant at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, I worked on the following projects:

* Foot-mounted indoor navigation system for indoor positioning. [\[<span style="color:blue">_More_</span>\]](/research/indoorpos/)
* Modeling and classification of vehicles using magnetometers. [\[<span style="color:blue">_More_</span>\]](/research/vehclass/)

At Rockwell Collins, Inc., I was involved in the

* Development of synoptic, and engine indication and crew alerting system, applications using model-based engineering for Embraer and Legacy jets.
