#### Target Detection using Weather Radars and Electromagnetic Vector Sensors
##### Background
There are 150 nearly identical dual-polarized S-band Doppler weather surveillance radars in the USA, with an observation range of 230 − 460 km and a range resolution of 0.25 − 1 km, depending on the mode of operation. There is a lack of statistical signal model that considers signal-dependent clutter model for target detection with weather surveillance radar as illuminator of opportunity. Exploiting the polarimetric information about the target with the help of diversely polarized antennas such as electromagnetic vector sensors has not been explored.

* We propose a _passive bistatic network_, with weather surveillance radar as the transmitter and electromagnetic vector sensor as the receiver.
* No previous work on passive bistatic radar _addressed_ employing a weather radar for target detection.
* We believe we are the _first_ to consider polarization information for _mitigating signal-dependent clutter_ in a passive bistatic radar.
* We propose a _maximum likelihood_ solution to extract the signal-subspace from the received data contaminated by the clutter interference.
* We also propose a _generalized likelihood ratio test_ detector that is robust to inhomogeneous clutter.
