### Target detection using weather radars and electromagnetic vector sensors
* We propose a passive bistatic network, with weather surveillance radar as the transmitter and electromagnetic vector sensor as the receiver.
* No previous work on passive bistatic radar addressed employing a weather radar for target detection.
* We believe we are the first to consider polarization information for mitigating signal-dependent clutter in a passive radar.
* We propose a maximum likelihood solution to extract the signal subspace from the received data contaminated by the clutter interference.
* We also propose a generalized likelihood ratio test detector that is robust to inhomogeneous clutter.
