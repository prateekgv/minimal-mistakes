#### Target detection using weather radars and electromagnetic vector sensors
* We propose a _passive bistatic network_, with weather surveillance radar as the transmitter and electromagnetic vector sensor as the receiver.
* No previous work on passive bistatic radar _addressed_ employing a weather radar for target detection.
* We believe we are the _first_ to consider polarization information for _mitigating signal-dependent clutter_ in a passive bistatic radar.
* We propose a _maximum likelihood_ solution to extract the signal-subspace from the received data contaminated by the clutter interference.
* We also propose a _generalized likelihood ratio test_ detector that is robust to inhomogeneous clutter.
